BEERVILLE (Project I)

Description  
Beerville is the easier way for the learning connoisseur to find legitimate breweries approved by an already experienced audience, while also having convenient tools for learning about certain popular beer brands and types. At the same time, making a platform for local breweries to advertise to a concentrated market (locals already interested in craft brew).

Motivation 
We need to find a more condensed search for local breweries, returning results of only establishments we are looking for and not a combined the "related" results. Also, educating beer hobbyists and creating an interest in local breweries in their area, in turn helping grow the craft beer market.

Results 
This will create an interest and generate a higher demand for craft beer locally working even further to popularize the brewery industry.

Challenges
